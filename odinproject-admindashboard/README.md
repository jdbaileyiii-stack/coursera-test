Home Ops Dashboard

Project from The Odin Project Intermediate HTML & CSS course. Built with HTML and CSS using Grid and Flexbox for layout.

Theme: “Home Ops” dashboard for fun. Icons from Material Design Icons. Font: Poppins from Google Fonts.

Just a layout practice dashboard based on the assignment structure, styled with my own theme and dummy content.
